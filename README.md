# Helm Chart for CVE Operator

This repository contains a Helm chart for deploying the CVE Operator with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). The CVE Operator is a tool used for managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the CVE Operator, ensure that you have the following environment variables set:

- `IMAGEPULLSECRETS`: The name of the secret used for pulling the container image.
- `BROKERS`: The list of Kafka brokers to connect to.
- `IMAGE`: The container image to use for the CVE Operator.
- `TAG`: The tag of the container image.
- `TOPIC`: The Kafka topic to publish CVE events to.

## Deployment

To deploy the CVE Operator using this Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Add the Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add cve-operator https://example.com/cve-operator
helm repo update
```

2. Install the chart:

```shell
helm install cve-operator cve-operator/cve-operator
```

3. Set the environment variables:

```shell
export IMAGEPULLSECRETS=my-secret
export BROKERS=kafka-broker-1,kafka-broker-2
export IMAGE=my-cve-operator-image
export TAG=1.0.0
export TOPIC=cve-events
```

4. Upgrade the deployment with the environment variables:

```shell
helm upgrade cve-operator cve-operator/cve-operator --set imagePullSecrets=$IMAGEPULLSECRETS,brokers=$BROKERS,image=$IMAGE,tag=$TAG,topic=$TOPIC
```

For more information on configuring and customizing the CVE Operator deployment, refer to the [official documentation](https://example.com/cve-operator/docs).
