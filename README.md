# Helm Chart for CVE Operator

This repository contains a Helm chart for deploying the CVE Operator with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). The CVE Operator is a tool used for managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the CVE Operator, ensure that you have the following environment variables set:

- `IMAGEPULLSECRETS`: The name of the secret used for pulling the container image.
- `BROKERS`: The list of Kafka brokers to connect to.
- `IMAGE`: The container image to use for the CVE Operator.
- `TAG`: The tag of the container image.
- `TOPIC`: The Kafka topic to publish CVE events to.

## Deployment

To deploy the CVE Operator using this Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. **Apply the CRDs:**

   Before installing the Helm chart, ensure that the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are applied:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f templates/crd
    ``` 

3. **Install the chart:**

   ```shell
   helm install operator /repo -n cve-operator
   ```

For more information on configuring and customizing the CVE Operator deployment, refer to the [official documentation](https://example.com/cve-operator/docs).
